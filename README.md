[Formatting](https://app.gitbook.com/s/xsLYiKUIBqHoFtXVlAsD/\~/changes/wMr2JG319o5kqv5POfSQ/guides/formatting)[Compiling and running your code](https://app.gitbook.com/s/xsLYiKUIBqHoFtXVlAsD/\~/changes/wMr2JG319o5kqv5POfSQ/guides/compiling-and-running-your-code)Derw is a programming language aimed at making complex apps in a simple way. It's built on top of TypeScript and Node, so it's easy to have interop with TypeScript.&#x20;

With Derw, you can write both frontend and backend code. The easiest way to write frontend code is with Derw's [html](https://github.com/derw-lang/html) package, which is built upon a model-view-update structure.

### What you'll find in this book

This book will walk you through creating projects, language syntax, working with existing TypeScript and Javascript codebases, and details on how the compiler works.
