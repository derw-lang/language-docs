**Good to know:** providing a brief overview of your product and its core use cases is a great place to start with product docs. Your product might seem obvious to you â€“ you made it! However, to others, even folks who are trying your product after reading your site or getting a sales demo, it can still be unclear. This is your chance to clarify your product and set the right expectations!

Derw is a programming language aimed at making complex apps in a simple way. It's built on top of TypeScript and Node, so it's easy to have interop with TypeScript.&#x20;

With Derw, you can write both frontend and backend code. The easiest way to write frontend code is with Derw's [html](https://github.com/derw-lang/html) package, which is built upon a model-view-update structure.
