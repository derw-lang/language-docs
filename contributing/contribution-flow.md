# Contribution flow

Contributions in the form of bug fixes and issues are most welcome. In terms of language design - reach out to me first on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/derwlang) to check if what you've got in mind fits with my plans. Communication is a great way of helping me understand why a pull request might be made, and helps me to help you contribute.

A couple of times a month, I go through the Derw-related repos and see if there's any issues or pull requests I can respond to or merge. Some issues I leave until later - particularly if it's part of some future plan that I might have. If there's something urgent, the best way to esclate is via Twitter. I check my Twitter notifications more frequently than Github.

Releases generally happen throughout the month, but at the end of every month I try to release a new version of Derw and update all the repos that use it - e.g the language server.
